sploit is currently developed by a two man team and the majority of our workflow
isn't publicly available.  We have a private issue tracker and we handle code
integration through email between us.  If we see significant community interest
in the project, we may create a public mailing list and maybe publicize our
issue tracker.  For now, though, if you want to contribute to sploit, the best
way to do so is to get in contact with one of us through email.

If you see something simple that needs to be fixed, feel free to create a patch
and email it to us!

If you have an issue that you can't/won't fix yourself but think it deserves
attention, shoot us an email!  We can give feedback on how your idea fits in
with our vision or get an issue tracked internally.

If you want to make a larger contribution, please reach out to us first so that
we can ensure your idea fits in with our vision before you spend a lot of time
on it.  After that, we will have you submit your work by emailing us patches.

We currently have no plans of using Github's issue tracker or Pull Request
systems.  If you submit things through them, they will likely be ignored.

Any submitted patches should contain a commit message following the style of
https://commit.style/ and including a sign-off.
```
$ git commit -s
```

Creating patches is easy with git send-email or git format-patch.  You can read
more about this process here https://git-send-email.io/.
```
$ git send-email origin/master --to=howcansocksbereal@gmail.com --subject-prefix="PATCH sploit"
```

Please try to follow the style of the surrounding code in the rest of the file.
If you add something new, make sure to add docstrings to the public API.  If you
modify existing code, make sure you update the docstrings accordingly.
